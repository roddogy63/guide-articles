### Some info on typographical alignment
There are four alignment types for typography.
 1. Flush left and ragged right. This is the default alignment for the web. Flush left and ragged right yields an even left margin and an     irregular right margin. This alignment is very legible
 2. Flush right and ragged left> This is the opposite of flush left and ragged right. The right margin is even and the left margin is         irregular. This should be used sparingly. When used one should take care to keep the line length free from very long or short lines.
 3. Centered alignment. This formal appearing alignment is good for small amounts of text, but is hard to read on large bodies of text.
 4. Justified alignment. The text is flush on both the left and right margins. This alignment can produce large and odd spacing between       words, especially if there are few words in the line.
