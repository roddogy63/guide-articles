### Six types of visual hierarchy
Six types of visual hierarchy.
1. Alignment: Alignment creates a sense of order and heirarchy on the page.
2. Contrast: Contrast imparts relative importance. The contrast between a light and dark background can serve to focus the user's attention on particular areas.
3. Size: Larger objects get our attention first. Size can be used to guide the user's attention to different portions of the page.
4. Color: Color draws the eye of the user. Contrasting colors can be used to drive users to different areas of the page and to enforce importance in the hierarchy.
5. Repetition: Repitition gives the user the sense that the repetitive elements belong together. It can also be used to get the user's attention, as in a block of brightly colored text suddenly appearing in the midst of repetitve black text paragraphs.
6. Proximity: Elements arranged in close proximity are assumed to belong together. The user knows these things are similar.
